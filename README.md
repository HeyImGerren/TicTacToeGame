### Improvements After Initial Completion
- use bootstrap instead of using your own CSS
- change up the database so that it limits the length of the password and the username because for now it's just accepting any length. 
- refactor app.js and possibly routes/index.js.
- add in password constraints that require users to have 1 capital letter, a number, and some kind of symbol in order to sign up (use regex).
